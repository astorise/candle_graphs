//! Demonstrates `Cache::append_at`: a graph captured once around a single
//! decode step, replayed at a *different* KV-cache position on every call by
//! updating a device-resident position tensor between replays -- instead of
//! `examples/cache`'s `append`, which bakes the write position into the graph
//! at capture time and can only ever write to that one slot on replay.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example decode_replay`
